# survival-game
This was a school project to learn nodejs and html canvas. The game started as 2d version of fortnite but ended up pivoting to a more survival type game.

I dockerized all of our previous code and made got rid of a bunch of extra folders 

To run execute docker compose up and the site should start on localhost:8000

made by me and ArshD1230 (on github)
